<li>The Problem</li>
<p>My intention with trying to build this was to learn the basic fundamentals of React and learn how to connect multiple pieces together that give birth to a simple application (I mean how to connect database, and backend , how to show data through APIs).
</p>

<p>These are the current features of the Foodie Club App, I will try my best to dynamically keep adding more improvised features and ensure it is adaptive to the basic requirements. </p>

<li>Restaurant Page [Menus- Option to Add to Cart - Increase/Decrease Quantity]</li>
<li>Cart Functionality [Maintainance of cart data - Calculation of Bill - Ability To Edit]</li>
</ul>
<br />
